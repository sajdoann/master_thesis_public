This folder contains data set for testing of sentence embeddings in Czech. For 
detailed description of the dataset read the following article:

1. Data
   1.1. Description
        The original Czech seed sentences were selected from Czech press, Global 
        Voices (Tiedemann, 2012) and OpenSubtitles (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016). 
        The seed sentences were manually annotated in two rounds of annotations.

        Round 1: 15 newspaper headlines were manually selected and annotators 
                 were asked to modify a headline up to 20 times and describe the
                 modification with a short name. Almost 1,000 sentences with 269 
                 described unique changes were collected and used as an inspira-
                 tion for second round of annotation.

        Round 2: Annotators were asked to modify 150 seed sentences using 15 
                 selected modifications (2x paraphrase different meaning, oppo-
                 site meaning, nonsense, minimal change, generalization, gossip, 
                 formal sentence, nonstandard sentence, simple sentence, possi-
                 bility, ban,future, past). More than 4,000 sentences intended 
                 for sentence embedding testing were collected.
   
   1.2. Data Format
        The data for both rounds of annotations are in their respective folders. 
        Both include two files:   annotations.tsv 
                                  source_sentences.tsv

        - source_sentences.tsv contains 3 columns: idx 
                                                   sentence
                                                   source

        - annotations.tsv contains 4 columns: idx - identifier of the source sentence
                                              user - anonymized user name
                                              change - name of the transformation
                                              sentence - modified sentence
